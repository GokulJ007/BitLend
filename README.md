## 💡 Example Workflow

### For a Borrower:
1. Alice deposits **ETH** as collateral.
2. She selects to borrow **SOL** with a defined LTV and interest rate.
3. Smart contract releases SOL and holds ETH in escrow.
4. Alice repays loan + interest on time → collateral unlocked.
5. If she defaults → collateral is automatically liquidated.

### For a Lender:
1. Bob deposits **BTC** into a lending pool.
2. Bob earns passive interest when his BTC is borrowed.
3. Funds remain safe via over-collateralized loans and on-chain enforcement.
